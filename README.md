# Manpreet Singh - Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my journey as a web developer. I'm focused on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Manpreet Singh, an aspiring web developer with a passion for turning ideas into reality through code. I'm currently building my skills in front-end development, with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to expand my knowledge and take on new challenges. While I'm still developing my expertise, I'm committed to writing clean, well-organized code and creating positive user experiences.

## Skills

Here are the technologies I'm currently working with:

* **HTML:** Building the structure of web pages.
* **CSS:** Styling web pages to be visually appealing.
* **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity to web pages (Basic level - actively learning more!).
* **Git & GitHub:** For version control and collaboration.
* **Microsoft Excel:** For data analysis and reporting (related to my professional experience, and I sometimes use it in web projects for handling data).

## Projects

This portfolio showcases the projects I've built to practice and demonstrate my skills:

* **Personal Portfolio Website:** This very website! It's built from scratch using HTML and CSS to present my work and skills. (GitHub repository: \[Link to be added soon])
* **To-Do List Layout:** A static design for a To-Do List application, created with HTML and CSS. I plan to add JavaScript functionality to make it fully interactive. (GitHub repository: \[Link to be added soon])
* **Product Landing Page:** A landing page designed to showcase a product or service, built with HTML and CSS. (GitHub repository: \[Link to be added soon])

**Note on Project Links:** I'm still in the process of finalizing and deploying these projects. The GitHub links will be updated as soon as they are available. Thank you for your patience!
